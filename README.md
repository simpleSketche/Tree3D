# Tree3D
The tool explores the semantics of design. Currently implemented in Grasshopper3D environment.
This tool experiements with the Composition design pattern over Inheritance, attempt to decouple the dependencies between objects.

## Task:
Use a software of your choice to create a computational design tool that could generate variations of the following design; You are given a hand sketch by our designer(see attached) and a description of design intent.


	“This is a bio-inspired decorative object. It takes inspiration from fractal patterns found in feathers and plants. Fine filaments at branch tips create an overall voluminous and plumose look. 

At **equal spacing along the central leader**, several scaffold branches protrude laterally in ""all directions around the leader axis**. Morphology of these branches is a blend between Gypsophila and ferns. 

Along the full length of the central leader, barbs protrude sideways, with an overall profile and texture like an ostrich feather.”


The design tool should allow the user to input numeric variables(numbers, array, matrices) or simple geometry, and output complex 3D objects.
